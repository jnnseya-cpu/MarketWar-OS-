# MarketWar OS — Requirements Coverage Matrix

**Purpose.** This is the master traceability register for the MarketWar OS repository. Every named agent,
module, engine, dashboard, score, pricing tier and data-model element found in the uploaded master notes
document (Document 1, preserved verbatim in `docs/reference/source-notes/`, parts 01–15) and in the
AI-OS Transformation Specification v3.0 (Document 2, `docs/reference/ai-os-specification-v3-imported.md`)
is mapped to its current status in this repository. Nothing has been dropped: if a requirement is not
implemented or specified, it is preserved verbatim and tracked here as backlog.

**Status legend**

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ IMPLEMENTED | Working code exists in this repo (`src/`), runnable today |
| 📘 SPECIFIED | Covered by the engineering blueprint (`docs/ai-os/01–08`, `docs/PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`) — buildable spec, no code yet |
| 📦 PRESERVED | Captured verbatim in `docs/reference/source-notes/` (backlog — not yet specified in the blueprint nor coded) |

**Sources & provenance**

- Verbatim source: `docs/reference/source-notes/` — 15 part files covering Document 1 lines 1–20537 (line refs below are Document 1 line numbers; each part's line range is listed in `source-notes/README.md`).
- Line-by-line inventories: `docs/reference/extraction-inventories/inventory-1.md` … `inventory-9.md`.
- Document 2 verbatim import: `docs/reference/ai-os-specification-v3-imported.md` (17 sections).
- Blueprint: `docs/ai-os/01-executive-vision-and-market.md` … `08-monetisation-security-roadmap.md`.

**Summary counts (rows per theme)**

| # | Theme | Rows | ✅ (incl. partial) | 📘 | 📦 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 14 | Document 2 — AI-OS Transformation Spec v3.0 | 18 | 0 | 18 | 0 |
| — | **Total requirement rows** | **401** | **122** | **96** | **183** |

Plus §15 Gaps & conflicts register (15 entries) and §16 Security note (8 redacted credential lines).
A row counted under ✅ may be "✅ partial" — working code covers the core of the requirement while the full
spec depth remains backlog; each row's own status cell is authoritative. Many 📦 rows enumerate multiple
named items (e.g. a 10-agent pack per row), so the underlying requirement count is far higher than 401.

## 15. Gaps & conflicts register

Conflicts found across the source documents, with a recommended resolution for each. None of these block
current code; all must be settled before the corresponding backlog items are promoted to 📘/✅.

| # | Conflict | Evidence | Recommended resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Subscription pricing: Starter £9 / Growth £19 (v1, Version A) vs Starter £5 / Growth £15 (Version B)** | Part 01 L238/L250 & Part 13 L14255/L14261 vs Part 14 L15314/L15320 | Adopt Version B (£5/£15) as the launch price — it is the later "Cheapest In Market + 5x profit" model and is margin-checked; keep £9/£19 as a post-traction step-up path. Record the decision in `docs/ai-os/08`. |
| 2 | **Campaign-pack vs subscription confusion (£5/£15/£49 packs alongside £5/£15 subscriptions)** | Part 10 L5709–5763 vs Part 14 L15305–15340 | Keep both but name them distinctly: subscriptions are recurring platform access; Campaign Packs™ are one-off ACU-priced products. Never render both as "Starter/Growth" in the same UI without the pack/plan suffix. |
| 3 | **Margin rules: 5x gross margin (400%) vs "66% minimum" vs 100%-minimum/300–500%-recommended utility framework** | Part 11 L6320 & Part 14 L14453–14470 vs Part 12 L8403/L8586–8601 vs Part 12 L7649–7655/Part 15 L18884–18890 | Treat them as different quantities: the 66% figure was a *competitive repricing of multipliers* (gross margin ≈ 66% = ~3x markup), not a replacement of the utility framework. Adopt: floor 66% gross margin per task (hard guardrail), target 400%+ blended via ACU recycling. Document in `docs/ai-os/08`. |
| 4 | **Prototype billing tiers £25/£99/£499 and strategy-doc tiers £9/£29/£99/£299, £19/£79/£199/£499 never reconciled with the master £5–£99 ladder** | Part 12 L8572–8601, L11417–11423, L11684–11722 | Scope them: £19–£499 sets belong to *separate add-on products* (Contact Agent, Growth Partner). The core OS keeps the Free/£5/£15/£39/£99 ladder; add-on products price independently. Flag any UI copy citing £25/£49 Starter as stale. |
| 5 | **Landing-page score sets: A = Clarity/Trust/Urgency/Emotional/Mobile/Speed/Conversion-Probability (7) vs B = Conversion/Clarity/Trust/Urgency/Mobile/Emotional/Friction/Lead-Quality (8)** | Part 13 L13849–13855 vs Part 14 L14924–14941 | Adopt Version B's 8-score set (it is the deep landing-page spec and includes definitions); keep Speed as a sub-signal of Mobile/Friction rather than a headline score. |
| 6 | **Campaign scoring: AI Campaign Score™ (8 dims) vs AI Campaign Confidence Score™ (7 dims, different set)** | Part 08 L4731–4755 vs Part 10 L5795–5819 | Keep both as distinct products, per the source's own note: Campaign Score™ = pre-build quality matrix; Confidence Score™ = pre-launch outcome prediction. Do not merge dimension lists. |
| 7 | **Audit score naming: "Follow-Up Readiness Score" (A) vs "Follow-Up Score" (B); 6-score implemented set vs 8-score spec set** | Part 13 L13486 vs Part 14 L14581; `src/backend/audit.ts` | **RESOLVED (2026-07-19):** `src/backend/audit.ts` now returns **9 scores** including Follow-Up Readiness, Revenue Leakage and Campaign Readiness — meets/exceeds the 8-score spec. Standardised on "Follow-Up Readiness Score". |
| 8 | **MVP phasing: 6 phases (Version A, ends with Marketplace) vs 5 phases (Version B, marketplace folded into Phase 5) vs 4-phase independence build order vs doc2's week-based Phase 0–3 roadmap** | Part 13 L14291–14335 vs Part 14 L15457–15495 vs Part 15 L18295–18339 vs doc2 §14 | Use doc2/`docs/ai-os/08` week-based roadmap as the master plan; map Version A Phase 6 (Marketplace) to its final phase. Keep Version A's 6-phase list as the feature checklist, Version B's for landing-page-first ordering. |
| 9 | **Collection-list deltas: 15 vs 53 (A) vs 55 (B) vs ~37 (dev spec) vs 71 (independence architecture) + 39 Brevo collections; Version B internally inconsistent (4.12 lists 12 landing-page collections but its own §16 core list repeats only 6)** | Part 01 L364; Part 13 L14133–14187; Part 14 L15399–15455 vs L14997–15009; Part 12 L13074–13111; Part 15 L18719–18790, L16873–16912 | Canonicalise on the 71-collection master list (Part 15 L18719–18790), then merge the 4 A-only collections (business_profiles, campaign_experiments, stripe_customers, google_business_posts), the 4 missing landing-page collections from 4.12 (landing_page_ctas, _assets, _pixels, _submissions), the 11 strategy-agent collections, and the non-overlapping Brevo collections. Maintain the merged list in `docs/ai-os/07`. |
| 10 | **Duplicated sections in the source** — Autonomous Campaign Engine appears twice (Parts 08 & 09, verbatim); 4.7 landing-page section duplicated (L6936–6957 ≈ L6983–7004); Brevo extraction has two passes (L16294–16928 vs L16929–17614); independence architecture has two passes (L17615–18358 vs L18359–18879); 39-collection list and API route blocks each appear twice | inv-5 §duplicate analysis; inv-6 note; inv-9 §3 | Treat Part 08, the second 4.7 copy's implementation notes, Brevo pass 2, and independence pass 2 as canonical. Parts 09 and the first passes remain preserved for provenance only — never spec from them. |
| 11 | **Source typo `trigger_retargerting`** (automation action name) | Part 15 L17153; inv-9 | Implement as `trigger_retargeting`; keep the typo untouched in source-notes (verbatim record) and note the correction wherever the action catalogue is specified. |
| 12 | **Autonomy level numbering: source uses Levels 1–3; blueprint uses dial L0–L3** | Part 08 L4651–4687 vs `docs/ai-os/02` | Adopt blueprint L0–L3 (L0 = manual/off). Map source Level 1→L1, 2→L2, 3→L3. |
| 13 | **File-boundary artefacts**: doc1 ends at line 20537 (not 20538); "FINAL OPERATING COMMAND" body crosses the Part 03/04 boundary; Part 05→06 header "THE MOST IMPORTANT DESIGN PRINCIPLE" also crosses a boundary | inv-9 note; inv-1 L850–851; inv-3 L2845 | No action needed — the part files are contiguous; readers following inventory line refs across part boundaries should read the adjoining part. |
| 14 | **Prototype-only features risk being mistaken for repo features** (Google Maps node, locale engine, papaparse CSV import, Firebase Studio pages) | Parts 04–12 Gemini build notes | The Firebase Studio prototype was discarded; only artefacts listed as ✅ in this register exist in this repo. Any "implemented" claim in the transcript is 📦 unless it appears in `src/`. |
| 15 | **doc2 GCP-only infrastructure vs adopted Hostinger→Cloudflare→Vercel→Firebase topology** | doc2 §13 vs `docs/PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md` | Resolved: `docs/PRODUCTION-ARCHITECTURE.md` is the adopted decision; doc2 §13 retained as reference for a future GCP scale-out. |

## 16. Security note — credential redaction & mandatory key rotation

Eight credential lines were found in the original uploaded document and were **redacted at import**
(replaced with redaction markers in `docs/reference/source-notes/12-build-transcript.md` and noted in
`source-notes/README.md` and `extraction-inventories/inventory-6.md`/`inventory-7.md`). No credential
values appear anywhere in this repository, this register included.

Redacted items (by type and original doc1 location — values NOT reproduced):

| # | Original location | Credential type |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | doc1 L7512 | OpenAI API key |
| 2 | doc1 L7516 | Same OpenAI key repeated in a curl Authorization header |
| 3 | doc1 L7519 | Google Gemini API key |
| 4 | doc1 L7521 | Vertex AI API key/token |
| 5 | doc1 L7523 | Full GCP service-account JSON (project ID, private_key_id, complete RSA private key, client_email, client_id) |
| 6 | doc1 L7525 | Anthropic Claude API key |
| 7 | doc1 L7528 | Same Anthropic key repeated in a curl x-api-key header |
| 8 | doc1 L6792 | Google Maps API key |

**Action required:** every one of these keys was exposed in the original document (and, per doc1 L7537,
written into a prototype `.env`). All five distinct credentials — OpenAI, Gemini, Vertex/GCP service account,
Anthropic, Google Maps — **must be rotated/revoked immediately** and never committed. Current code reads
providers exclusively from environment variables (`src/backend/provider.ts`, `src/backend/firebase-admin.ts`);
see `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for environment configuration.

## 17. Owner rulings log

Live decisions by the owner that resolve register conflicts. These override
earlier conflicting rules; superseded rules remain preserved in the verbatim
sources per the Additive-Only Law.

| Date | Ruling | Resolves | Codified |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-09 | All exposed credentials cancelled/rotated | Security register (8 redacted keys) | `docs/reference/VERIFICATION.md` |
| 2026-07-09 | **Additive-Only Law**: everything added builds on top or upgrades; never delete, never downgrade | Governs all future content | `/CLAUDE.md`, docs/README.md |
| 2026-07-09 | **Pricing doctrine**: margin never below 100% (≥2× provider cost) AND pricing must stay extremely competitive/attractive — compete on cost base, not margin erosion. 300–500% band + tier targets apply above the floor | Margin-rule conflict (66% vs 4×/5×/400%/35% entries, §15) — 66% guardrail superseded | `docs/ai-os/08` §A.1a, `/CLAUDE.md` |
| 2026-07-11 | **Multi-brand single account**: one user account runs multiple brands/activities at the same time with one login and one bill, on subscription or other payment models/categories — financially attractive first, 100% margin protection built in | Extends U1 (was implicitly single-brand); distinct from Agency U4 | `docs/ai-os/02` §U1a, `docs/ai-os/08` §A.1c; shipped: brand switcher (`src/components/BrandSwitcher.tsx`) + billing "Brands on this account" |
| 2026-07-13 | **VisualStrike/SiteRaid 4× rule**: for the two engines' generation actions, Customer ACU Charge ≥ Actual Provider Cost × 4 (non-negotiable) | Sits above the global 100% (2×) floor — floor unchanged platform-wide; matches the video engines' 4× minimum | `docs/ai-os/10` §H |
| 2026-07-13 | **Autonomy L4 (Revenue Autopilot)** added above L3 for engine publishing/budget reallocation; high-risk categories locked to L0/L1; all L3 gates (TOTP, £500 escalation, 60-s reversal) apply unchanged at L4 | Extends the L0–L3 dial (doc 02 §2) — additive | `docs/ai-os/10` §F; `/dashboard/settings` dial |
| 2026-07-14 | **M-34 AI Transactional Email Engine** (owner: massive transactional provider, unlimited daily volume, never landing in spam, addresses filtered, no bounce-backs) — delivered as deliverability engineering: multi-provider pool (unlimited infra, AI-governed warm-up ramp), earned inbox placement (SPF/DKIM/DMARC/BIMI + consent + engagement warm-up + RFC 8058 — never filter-evasion), 4-stage live hygiene pipeline, zero-bounce doctrine (pre-send filter + permanent suppression ledger, target < 0.5%) | New module + Agent 23; composes with M-22 notifications + doc 08 consent architecture | `src/backend/email.ts`, `/api/email`, `/dashboard/email`, `email-commander` agent, `docs/ai-os/11-email-engine.md` |
| 2026-07-19 | **M-35 Viral Amplification & Retargeting Engine** — owner asked for "109× viral" + "show everyone leaving cookies the content 5×/day until they act", then confirmed "do the correct and legal way". Literal cross-web-surveillance + uncapped-frequency version DECLINED (breaches PECR/GDPR + platform consent architecture + ad-network policy + M-34 sender reputation). Delivered the outcome lawfully: earned virality (honest viral coefficient K) + consent-based, funnel-only retargeting capped at 5 touches/7 days/person, hard opt-out & conversion stops | Conflict with doc 08 §B.3 consent architecture — resolved by building the compliant mechanism, not the literal ask | `src/backend/amplify.ts`, `/api/amplify`, `/dashboard/amplify`, `amplification-strategist` agent, `docs/ai-os/12-amplification-engine.md` |
| 2026-07-19 | **Self-growth doctrine**: MarketWar OS supports its users AND supports itself to grow — it uses its own OS to acquire its own users and compound to market leadership; every product improvement is a growth improvement; self-growth stays inside the platform's own consent/frequency/margin/compliance laws | New binding principle; strengthens the existing dogfooding references (doc 03 §3, doc 08 §A.3) | `docs/ai-os/01` §1.6 |
| 2026-07-19 | **Worldwide localization**: MarketWar OS is a global platform — auto-detect the viewer's language from device settings and currency from device locale, no manual setting | Owner directive (Document 1 build transcript, restated) | Foundation shipped: `src/frontend/locale.ts` (Intl + navigator, region→currency map, `useLocale()`); money-surface rollout (26 £-sites) + language i18n = follow-through |
| 2026-07-13 | **Layered codebase + stabilisation + E2E encryption**: backend/frontend/shared physical separation with runtime layer guards; stabilisation gates (`npm run verify` + `npm run smoke` — 53 checks: 26 routes, security headers, all 21 agents, audit + gateway APIs; global error boundary + not-found); E2EE = TLS 1.3 + HSTS-preload headers in transit, AES-256-GCM per-business-key field encryption at rest wired into every persistence write (cross-tenant decrypt cryptographically blocked — verified), plaintext-at-model-boundary honestly documented | Behaviour-preserving refactor per Additive-Only Law; implements doc 08 §B.4a field-encryption rule in code | `src/backend/` + `src/shared/` + `src/frontend/` (layer READMEs), `src/backend/crypto.ts`, `next.config.mjs`, `scripts/smoke.mjs`; docs: `docs/ai-os/06` §11, `docs/ai-os/08` §B.3a |

**Gap/conflict addendum (§8.2 design system):** v3.0 spec tokens (navy #1A1A2E, accent #E94560, gold #F5A623, light surface #F4F6F9, Inter-only typography) vs the shipped owner-approved emerald-dark system (Space Grotesk + Inter, validated chart palette). Resolution: shipped system remains primary brand; spec tokens preserved in doc 06 as the specified alternate theme (candidate for admin/partner portals or theme switcher). Owner may re-decide.

**Agent-roster numbering note (2026-07-19 audit, updated for M-36 + Visual Engine):**
the shipped `AGENTS` map in `src/shared/agents.ts` holds **32 runnable agents**
(+ Agent 27 Opportunity Scout + Agent 28 Lead Hunter, the Serper live-web
intelligence agents; + Agent 29 Reputation Guardian, the Trustpilot-inspired
reviews/reputation agent; + Agent 30 Growth ROI Strategist + Agent 31 Executive
Marketing War Room, the AI Growth-OS ROI + executive-email agents).
Agent 32 is the AI Auto-Segmentation Agent (Brevo Module 19); Agents 33–34 are
the ICP Architect + Outreach Commander (Apollo-inspired LeadWar Room); Agent 35
is the AI Automation Architect (Brevo Module 7 no-code builder); Agent 36 is
the AI Landing Page Creation Agent (§4.6 — the central agent); Agents 37–38 are
the Customer Avatar + Marketing Battle Plan agents (the 7-agent strategy chain
bookends).
The numbered lineage in agent prompts runs 1–31 because **Agent 20 (Profit
Protection & Margin Intelligence)** is realised as the AI Gateway cost policy
+ the Admin margin dashboard (`/dashboard/admin`) rather than a standalone
conversational key (documented in `03a-agent-cards.md`). Breakdown:
19 original conversational agents (1–19) + Agent 21 VisualStrike + Agent 22
SiteRaid + Agent 23 Email Commander + Agent 24 Amplification Strategist +
Agent 25 Campaign Warfare (`campaign-warfare-strategist`, the M-36 flagship) +
Agent 26 Brand Visual Creation (`brand-visual-creation`, the AI Visual Creation
Engine) = 25 lineage-numbered keys, **plus 2 Strike-phase agents labelled by MW
code rather than the 1–26 lineage** (`geo-recon` = MW-04, `citation-radar` =
MW-02) = **27 runnable keys**. Smoke gate asserts ≥ 27 (`scripts/smoke.mjs`).

**Trademark-alias index (2026-07-19 audit — features already tracked, aliases added for name-search):**
- **Creative Payloads™** (`source-notes/11` L727) = the Ad Creative Agent's output — ✅ shipped as `ad-creative` (§1.1 / §1.3 Agent 4.5).
- **Brand Asset Vault™** (`source-notes/11` L323) = the Brand-Consistent Creative Engine + `brand_assets`/BrandAsset schema (§2.3 row above, 📦).
- **MarketWar Reputation Shield™** (`source-notes/12` L2417/L2428) = the Trustpilot Trust/Reviews/Reputation Engine pack + TrustScore™ (§9 row above, 📦).

| Requirement | Source | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hook Laboratory™ card must be literally true (130+ scored hooks)** | Owner directive 2026-07-21 (overclaim = reputation damage) | ✅ | `hookLab()` in `src/backend/visualstrike.ts` now generates **130 hooks across 13 families × 10 variants** (`HOOK_FAMILIES`), each scored + deception-checked; returns `count`/`families`/`byFamily`. Was 10. |
| **No feature may misrepresent itself as live to a tester** | same | ✅ | `/dashboard/product-engine` badges every capability **Live now** vs **Coming at P1** (StatusChip) + an honesty legend; upload zone, studios, campaign modes and guarantees all labelled truthfully |

| Verified | same | ✅ | typecheck + check:layers + build (121 pages) + smoke 320/0 (hook test strengthened: asserts count>=130 and families===13); live curl 130/13 confirmed |

## 36. Test-ready hardening — every module wired to a real engine (2026-07-21)

Owner directive: "I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE LIVE — NO PARTIAL AND NO STATIC." Every
dashboard module now calls a real backend engine and renders computed output;
no static demo arrays, no hardcoded fake numbers, no placeholder cards presented
as working. Clean-slate brands show honest empty-states; render/publish features
are honestly badged Live-now vs Coming-at-P1.

| Module | Was | Now | Engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| Customer Vault | STATIC (demoCustomers) | ✅ LIVE | `segments.ts` `scoredCustomerList` via `/api/segments` action=customers |
| Lead Recovery | STATIC (recoverable=1240) | ✅ LIVE | new `recovery.ts` via `/api/recovery` (reuses segment scoring) |
| WhatsApp Center | STATIC (demo arrays) | ✅ LIVE | new `whatsapp.ts` via `/api/whatsapp` (funnel + template pipeline) |
| Campaign War Room | STATIC (demoCampaigns) | ✅ LIVE | new `warroom.ts` via `/api/warroom` (real ledger revenue when brandId) |
| Competitor Spy | PARTIAL (demoCompetitors) | ✅ LIVE | existing `competitor-warroom.ts` via `/api/competitor-warroom` (+threatLevel) |
| Local Domination | PARTIAL (fake stats) | ✅ LIVE | new `local.ts` via `/api/local` (map-pack + prioritized actions) |
| Email Center | PARTIAL (fake 99.4% etc) | ✅ LIVE | new `email-metrics.ts` via `/api/email-metrics` (labelled estimates) |
| Budget Protection | PARTIAL (fake £130) | ✅ LIVE | new `budget.ts` via `/api/budget` (Stop/Fix/Scale board) |
| Command Center root | STATIC-ish | ✅ LIVE | new `command-summary.ts` via `/api/command-summary` (briefs the real ledger; robust to partial bodies) |
| Admin Centre | PARTIAL (hardcoded economics) | ✅ LIVE | existing `admin-economics.ts` via `/api/admin-economics` |
| Settings & Security | PARTIAL (unpersisted dial) | ✅ LIVE | new `settings-store.ts` via `/api/settings` (Firestore/in-memory) |
| SiteRaid AI | PARTIAL (static suites) | ✅ LIVE + honest P1 badges | existing `siteraid.ts` via `/api/siteraid` |
| Video War Room | PARTIAL (12 fake studio cards) | ✅ LIVE + honest P1 badges | existing `video-intelligence.ts` via `/api/video-intelligence` |
| Integration Hub | PARTIAL (green when unconfigured) | ✅ honest per-provider state | existing `/api/integrations` (surfaces adminConfigured) |

All engines are deterministic (FNV-1a seed, no wall-clock/randomness), layer-guarded,
and demo-safe (render with zero keys). Additive-only: `src/shared/demo.ts` and all
existing exports untouched — pages simply stopped importing demo arrays.

Verified: typecheck + check:layers + build (clean, SWC cache cleared) + smoke **329/0**
(+9 new module-engine assertions, incl. a command-summary malformed-body regression test).

## 37. How-it-works truth pass — 3 claims made literally true + connector-honest verbs (2026-07-21)

A code-level audit of the 7-phase "How it works" page found the intelligence real
but 3 specific claims overclaiming and several execution verbs implying autonomy
that is connector-gated. Fixed:

| Phase | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| **1 Brain Sync** ("…margins…") | onboarding never asked cost/margin | ✅ added "Rough margin or unit cost" question to onboarding intake |
| **6 Budget Protection** ("weekly money-saved receipt") | no such code | ✅ `budget.ts` computes `weeklyReceipt` (protected/reroute/paused + headline); rendered on /dashboard/budget |
| **7 Recovery** ("forecasts next month's money") | LLM narrative / hardcoded £1,500/2,400/3,100 | ✅ new deterministic `forecast.ts` + `/api/forecast` (base/push/stretch from the real ledger: run-rate + open-lead upside); rendered on /dashboard/revenue |

Connector-honest wording (true today as plans, auto once connected): Phase 4 "deploys"
→ "designs… then launches once your ad accounts connect"; Phase 5 "send offers / book
orders / sequences fire" → "built to… live capture/sending switch on when you connect
WhatsApp/email"; Phase 6 "paused automatically" → "flagged to pause — auto-pause once
your ad accounts connect"; Phase 3 dropped unmodelled "guarantees"/"before it ships".
Phases 2 (audit) and 3 (offer margin-safety) were already fully true.

All deterministic (no wall-clock/randomness), layer-guarded, demo-safe, additive-only.
Verified: typecheck + check:layers + clean build + smoke **333/0** (+4: forecast
monotonic+deterministic, forecast empty-state, forecast malformed-body hardened, weekly receipt).

## 38. Zernio publish connector — platform-managed, white-label (2026-07-21)

Owner directive: platform-level social publishing, users billed through their plan.
Adopted Zernio (white-label — preserves the "not a wrapper" doctrine) over Ayrshare.

| Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **One platform key fans out to 15 channels** | ✅ | `zernio.ts` (Bearer `ZERNIO_API_KEY`, base `https://zernio.com/api`); `ZERNIO_PLATFORMS` (IG/TikTok/FB/YouTube/LinkedIn/X/Pinterest/Reddit/Bluesky/Telegram/GBP/Snapchat/Discord/WhatsApp/Threads) |
| **White-label, no per-platform app review** | ✅ | brand connects own socials via minted `POST /v1/profiles` → `/v1/platform-invites/{token}/connect` link; Zernio hosts the OAuth |
| **One-click connect + publish UI** | ✅ | `/dashboard/publish` Publish Center (connect link + compose/schedule/cross-post) + sidebar entry |
| **Compliance gate + AI-content watermark before ship** | ✅ | `complianceGate()` (prohibited-claim block) + AI watermark appended in `publishPost()` |
| **Platform-managed + ACU-seat billing at protected margin** | ✅ | `integrations.ts` `zernio_publish` (provisioning `platform`, billing `acu_metered`) + `seatQuote()` (plan seats + overflow via `quoteAcu`, margin ≥2×/4×, provider cost never exposed) |
| **Autonomy preserved (pooled + manual fallback)** | ✅ | `PROVIDER_POOLS.publishing` + manualFallback (download creative + copy caption + post manually) |
| **Live REST wired, demo-safe** | ✅ | `POST /v1/posts` live when key set; deterministic demo (published/watermarked) + graceful degrade on any live error; `/api/zernio` GET status + POST connect/publish/profiles/quote |
| **Deployed app picks up the key** | ✅ | `apphosting.yaml` → `ZERNIO_API_KEY` (secret `zernio-api-key`) |
| Verified | ✅ | typecheck + check:layers + clean build + smoke **339/0** (+6: status/connect/publish/compliance-block/seat-billing/hub-listing) |

## 39. Generated content → one-click publish (2026-07-21)

| Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **VisualStrike + Content Factory publish generated content** | ✅ | both pages now render `GenerateAndPublish` (AgentRunner + `PublishToChannels`) — the copy the agent just produced seeds the publish caption |
| **Publish routes through the Zernio gateway** | ✅ | `PublishToChannels` POSTs `/api/zernio` action=publish (compliance gate + AI watermark), demo-safe / live with key |
| **Reusable, non-breaking** | ✅ | `AgentRunner` gained an optional `onResult` callback (existing callers unaffected); `PublishToChannels` + `GenerateAndPublish` are additive components; links to the full Publish Center to connect socials |
| Verified | ✅ | typecheck + check:layers + clean build + smoke 339/0; /dashboard/product-engine, /content, /publish all 200 |

## 40. One-click publish on every content generator (2026-07-21)

| Surface | Publish action | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Campaign Builder** (Ad creative tab) | ✅ | `GenerateAndPublish` (ad-creative agent → publish) |
| **Offer Builder** (Offer tab) | ✅ | `GenerateAndPublish` (offer-builder agent → publish) |
| **Brand Studio** (creative direction) | ✅ | `GenerateAndPublish` (brand-visual-creation agent → publish; images stay preview until hosted-URL posting) |
| **VisualStrike Hook Lab** | ✅ | new `VisualStrikeHooks` — generates the 130-hook library (/api/visualstrike), pick a hook → `PublishToChannels` |

All route through the Zernio gateway (`/api/zernio`, compliance gate + AI watermark),
reuse the shared `PublishToChannels`/`GenerateAndPublish` components, additive-only.
Verified: typecheck + check:layers + clean build + smoke 339/0; campaigns/offers/studio/product-engine all 200.

## 41. Attach generated creative (image/video) to posts (2026-07-21)

| Requirement | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Posts carry media, not just caption** | ✅ | `PublishToChannels` accepts `defaultMediaUrls`, previews thumbnails, passes `mediaUrls` to `/api/zernio` |
| **Only hosted media posts; demo/preview dropped honestly** | ✅ | `zernio.ts` `postableMedia()` keeps http(s) only; result carries `mediaCount` + `droppedMedia`; UI badges demo creatives "preview — won't attach until live rendering returns a hosted URL" |
| **Brand Studio attaches a chosen creative** | ✅ | `/dashboard/studio` — click a variant to select, publish panel attaches its `imageUrl` + headline/offer/CTA caption |
| **VisualStrike renders flow into media** | ✅ (wiring ready) | same `mediaUrls` path — VisualStrike image/video renders attach the moment live rendering returns hosted URLs (image render is P1) |
| Verified | ✅ | typecheck + check:layers + clean build + smoke **341/0** (+2: hosted image attaches, demo data: URI dropped) |
